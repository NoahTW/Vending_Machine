Buy Snacks From A Vending Machine.

This project aims to have the user buy items from a vending machine.
Vending machine reads a list of different candy types, and populates the vending machine shelves with various types of candy for purchase.

Files can be downloaded to run as a console app.
The code has been written to be scalable, so infinitely new candies can be added to the candylist.csv file to add more options to the vending machine.
However, only up to 9 different types of candies will be displayed at one time.
